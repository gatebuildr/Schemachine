Schemachine is a command line interpreter that parses user input and creates a
model of a world containing physical objects, which may have positional
relationships with each other.  It can also answer questions about the state
of the world according to its model.

Execution:
This directory is an eclipse project, which can be loaded and run (the main
class is interpreter.Interpreter), but the easiest way to run it is to execute
"java -jar Schemachine.jar" from a console.
